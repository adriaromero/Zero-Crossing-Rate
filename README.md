# Zero-Crossing-Rate
The zero-crossing rate (ZCR) is the rate of sign-changes along a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.

Run the 'ZCR_application.m' file. It will upload the audio file 'sample.wav' and will plot three plots (ZCR, Hamming windowed and energy).
